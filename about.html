                <H2>Chronoshift's Goal</H2>
                <p>At Chronoshift Expeditions, the hunts are as authentic as possible. When creating a hunt, trained safari leaders go out and mark animals for hunting. When an animal is marked, the hunter is then able to kill the target. Be careful, as the flow of time could be disturbed if the rules are not followed.</p>

                <H2>Chronoshift's History</H2>
                <p>Chronoshift was founded in 2021, in the town of Clovis, California. Initially, the founders of Chronoshift didn't think it'd succeed, but were proven wrong when the first expeditions were well recieved. When the expeditions were found successful and liked, more were created as the technology progressed. The technology, however, was not well recieved by the government and Chronoshift was placed on very heavy restriction. The technology used is fragile, and could easily be derailed by one simple mistake. However, the ones working it know how to use it to take hunters back in time to do some of the most exhilirating hunts man has to offer.</p>
